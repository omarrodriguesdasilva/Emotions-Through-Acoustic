# Emotions-Through-Acoustic
Project: Emotions Through Acoustic - performance evaluation 

This project makes a performance evaluation of three algorithms which make a emotion recognition using acoustic features: Deep, RosaJr and Souza. Each folder contains the code used to evaluate the performance for each algorithm. 

This code refers to the article on IEEE Latin American Transactions, "Performance evaluation of emotion recognition
algorithms in Brazilian Portuguese language audios", submission ID 9577.
